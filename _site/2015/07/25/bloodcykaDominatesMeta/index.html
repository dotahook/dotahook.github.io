<p>Bloodseeker, or as some prefer to call him, Bloodcyka, is rocketing back into the pro scene after a long absence brought upon by the popularity of the Vici Gaming deathball followed by the dark days of HOHO HAHA. We were recently blessed with a complete overhaul to Bloodseeker’s skills, upgrading the blade-wielding red Sonic from a mere pubstomper that capitalized on lack of coordination to a speedy teamfighting beast who combos well with powerful nukers, enhancing their damage with Bloodrage to vaporize enemy heroes with a single strike. Many will remember with fondness the early days of Bloodseeker’s new kit, which allowed Bloodrage to affect global spells like Zeus’s Thundergod’s Wrath and Nature’s Prophet’s Wrath of Nature with ridiculous results highlighted in several videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCJMYUFMB5k&amp;">like this one</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, those days are over, but Bloodseeker’s shortage of weaknesses make counterplay more frustrating than fun. His sustain from Bloodrage makes him difficult to zone when every last hit provides more than a tango’s worth of health. Even with constant right-click harass, he just needs to continue last-hitting and he’ll be topped off again. With all of his bonus damage and a Quelling Blade, it’s nearly impossible for him to lose his lane. He doesn’t need much gold, either. Just a few levels and he packs a huge punch. . His mobility is rarely an issue as Thirst gives him the insane speed he needs to hunt down fleeing heroes, and the same passive also gives him tons of extra damage. What he really needs is attack speed, which he gets from Power Treads and Sange and Yasha and turns into a disable through Skull Basher. Rupture is especially aggravating as it forces immediate rotations or the ruptured hero to attempt to teleport home, provided they aren’t something with high mobility like Storm Spirit or Ember Spirit. With a little help from a disabler, early Ruptures make for easy kills on isolated heroes. For teams with cores that typically take a while to come online like Spectre, the constant ganks (due to the low cooldown on Rupture) are especially punishing.</p>

<p>His Dotabuff stats are especially telling. His win rate has steadily risen (though it hasn’t yet reached “pubstomp “ levels like Leshrac) and his pick rate climbed 10 percent in the last month as players realizehow well he’s suited for this patch. Soon he’ll be contesting Pudge for top dog. . The changes to gold gain in the current patch make ganking more profitable than farming, so other carries just can’t compete with the rate at which he acquires his core items while their farm is repeatedly disrupted. Note how his best matchups are against farm-intensive cores such as Spectre, Weaver and Anti-Mage in addition to heroes that rely on slows for crowd control like Omniknight and Undying. Since his strongest matchups are against traditional pubstompers (Abaddon, Omniknight, Undying, Spectre, and Silencer), he is often a reliable choice, punishing greedy team compositions especially.</p>

<p>His weaknesses? Heroes that can outmaneuver a Bugatti (Storm Spirit, Puck, Ember Spirit) tank his Rupture (Alchemist, Morphling, Axe), or teleport away (like Io, Nature’s Prophet and Tinker). Unfortunately, most of the heroes that are good counters to Bloodseeker are either difficult to play (Earth Spirit, Oracle and Io) or simply ill-suited for the current mid-game meta (Alchemist, Morphling and Lone Druid). Picking a counter to Bloodseeker like an illusion spammer often means opening yourself up for other weaknesses that can be exploited with heroes like Leshrac, which explains why he is much likelier to be banned than picked in the pro scene. It’s a testament to Bloodseeker’s power in this patch that even at the highest tier of play, few people want to have deal with his bullshit.</p>
