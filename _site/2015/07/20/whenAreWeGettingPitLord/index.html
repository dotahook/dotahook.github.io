<p>With TI5 around the corner, many people expect the release of one of the two heroes that have yet to be added to the game. At TI4 we saw the release of Techies, a hero that quickly found its place at the bottom of the hero list sorted by win rate with something around 40%. In a year’s time, he has been buffed repeatedly until he is where he is today: one of the most popular (and hated) heroes in the game and with a win rate hovering around 53%. As to what possessed Icefraud to buff the hero to the point where EG.Sumail immediately conceded defeat after queuing against a skilled Techies player and proceeded to feed until he lost, we will never know. The point is, don’t expect much from the new heroes. Give them a little time and a few buffs, and suddenly you’ll be groaning every time you see one on the enemy team.</p>

<p>We’re currently waiting on two heroes to be added, Abyssal Underlord (formerly Pit Lord) and Arc Warden. What we do know is that Abyssal Underlord is definitely coming sooner than Arc Warden, as his model has already been added to the game, and what would TI be without a new hero reveal? Assuming we do get Abyssal Underlord soon, I think it would be helpful to go over what we know about this hero already. Keep in mind I never played this hero during my brief stint in DotA All-Stars, so anything written here is purely conjecture.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about stats. His strength and intelligence growth are decent, but his agility gain is very low, so there’s not much chance of him building into a right-click carry later on. His goal is merely to stay close to the team fight and not die, making sure that his aura affects as many enemy heroes as possible.
His first skill, Firestorm, is a repeated magical AOE nuke that hits six times over six seconds with added burn damage for each hit. It will do impressive damage to anything unfortunate to remain inside its radius for the full duration of six-seconds and not much else, so this skill seems to be more effective as wave-clear rather than a team fight skill unless used with a long-duration disable like Chronosphere or Reverse Polarity. It can also provide decent area denial.</p>

<p>His next skill, Pit of Malice is a short-duration AOE root that goes through spell immunity and can’t be dispelled. You throw a pit on the ground that lasts seven seconds and if enemies find their way into it, they are damaged and can’t move, but they can still do everything else. It seems pretty lackluster on its own, but good for setting up a follow-up stun or AOE like Firestorm.</p>

<p>His passive, Atrophy Aura, makes Abyssal Underlord a considerable threat later in the game as it provides a debuff to all enemies in a modest radius. This aura has two effects: the first is similar to a slightly more powerful Vengeance Aura reducing enemy damage by a certain percentage (with a Vengeful Spirit on your team you could potentially lower enemy attack damage by almost 80%) while the second effect has some similarity to Elder Titan’s Astral Spirit, causing every enemy unit that dies under this effect to buff Abyssal Underlord’s damage. The low radius of this passive suggests that this hero has some carry potential if he goes full tank mode, allowing him to walk up to enemies and punch them in the face while they do significantly less damage in return. Also, it would increase his farming speed in the jungle. Needless to say, this damage debuff is significant enough to the point where the enemy will make this hero their number one priority to eliminate from the equation.</p>

<p>Lastly we come to the most insane spell, Dark Rift, basically an AOE Relocate that can pull your entire team to a location anywhere on the map, provided that there is a building or lane creep to teleport to. It could be used for some interesting ganking tactics, but in most games I expect to see this used more for split-pushing and ratting. Looking at his skills altogether, split-pushing seems to be the most obvious way of playing the hero, with some possibility of becoming a tanky anti-carry in the late-game.</p>
