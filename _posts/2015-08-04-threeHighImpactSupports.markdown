![Three High Impact Supports](http://dotahook.github.io/assets/articleImages/ThreeSupportsListing.jpeg)


Players typically shy away from picking supports in lower MMR solo queue, and not without good reason. Supports are popularly thought of as unable to turn a game around in the face of incompetent teammates, and players rightly believe that by picking support they are dooming themselves to watch their towers fall as their carries go 0/10 while declaring “noob support”. Hence, solo queue games with no courier and no wards are despair-inducingly common in the trench as a team of five carries compete among themselves for the farm they need. While a support hero will never be able to 1v5 the enemy team like a farmed carry, there are a handful of supports that can have an outsize impact on the game (even with terrible teammates). So think twice before deciding to be your team’s fifth carry, the key to victory may lie in selflessly supporting your comrades.

Here are three supports that can get solo kills, swing a teamfight, and are new player friendly to boot.

### 1. Lion

Lion is one of the most popular support heros of all time and it’s easy to see why: with a pair of strong disables, the ability to drain the mana of his enemies, and a formidable nuke, he has an excellent set of abilities. A combo of Lion’s two damage dealing abilities, Earthspike and his ultimate, Finger of Death, can one shot most heroes early game. Lion’s low move speed and general squishiness do make him vulnerable, so make sure you pay attention to your positioning and stay close to your teammates!

### 2. Earthshaker

Earthshaker is another very popular support, with a great set of stuns with high damage output. His ultimate, Echo Slam, is potentially devastating in team fights, where it can potentially wipe the enemy team, a good Echo Slam  can help a struggling team come back from behind. A full combo of Fissure, Enchant Totem, and Echo Slam can solo kill many heroes, particularly in the early game. Earthshaker does require more farm than many supports however, as Blink Dagger is more or less required for proper positioning and initiation/counter initiation. With this in mind be sure to stay alive and take farm where you can.

### 3. Witch Doctor

Although his ultimate can be difficult to land, Witch Doctor is an ideal hero for beginners. His stun, Paralyzing Cask, is an excellent disable which has the potential to stop the enemy team in its tracks with a few good bounces. His heal can keep your allies alive during team fights and help your carry stay in lane. Maledict, if cast at the beginning of a fight, can output huge damage on to more than one target. Death Ward deals enormous amounts of physical damage and, if coupled with Paralysing Cask, can be used to solo kill most heroes. This maneuver is particularly effective against heroes without a way of disrupting Death Ward’s channeling (stuns, bashes, etc). Death Ward’s major weakness is that it is channeled and can thus be interrupted. With this in mind Black King Bar, or Glimmer Cape are essential items on Witch Doctor.
