![Three New Player Friendly Carries](http://dotahook.github.io/assets/articleImages/threeCariesListing.jpg)

A carry is often the first choice of players looking to increase their MMR and this choice is a logical one. When played correctly, carries have the potential to completely dominate the game, as the Youtube videos of Miracle destroying his opponents can attest. It is however, extremely difficult to play carries effectively due to their relative weakness in the early game. To overcome this weakness carries need a huge amount of farm, which comes from last hitting, getting kills, and dying infrequently(or not at all). None of this is easy.

With that said, some carries are more forgiving than others and are thus suited to new players. Here are three heroes that are ideal starting points for the aspiring carry player.

### 1. Phantom Assassin

Phantom Assassin is  a melee carry that is very often picked in pub matches and recently received the Arcana treatment with the Manifold Paradox set. Phantom Assassin’s abilities make her uniquely friendly to the new player: Stifling Dagger’s low mana cost and low cool down means that it can be used to last hit from a distance while taking harassment. Stifling Dagger can also be used to harass the enemy and to chase. Phantom Strike, while primarily intended for initiation, can also be used to escape a sticky situation. Blur, Phantom Assassin’s first passive, can be helpful when taking harras as it mitigates some of the damage you take. It can also make Phantom Assassin unexpectedly durable in manfights against other heroes if RNG is on your side. Phantom Assassin’s ultimate, Coup de Grace, ensures that she scales into late game. If Coup de Grace procs a few times in a row it can easily melt tanky heroes in a flurry of blood spurts and big red numbers.

### 2. Drow Ranger

Drow Ranger, like Phantom Assassin, is a fixture of the pub meta. Drow’s high damage and high attack speed make her a formidable, albeit fragile, opponent in the late game if sufficiently farmed. Her power, coupled with her mechanical simplicity makes her an ideal pick for new players. Drow’s orb effect, Frost Arrows, is an effective slow, which can make executing ganks against mobile heroes much easier. Players wishing to learn the fine art of orb walking could also do worse than to practice with Drow and Frost Arrows. Gust, Drow’s other active ability, is a silence that also pushes enemy heroes back. It is best used to push away gap closing melee heroes so that Drow can kill them before they close to melee range. Precision Aura, passivley increases Drow’s damage, as well as the damage of Drow’s ranged allies, it can also be cast to increase the damage (and thus pushing power) of allied creeps. Marksmanship, Drow’s ultimate, provides her with a large agility bonus, which in turn increases her damage, attack speed, and armour.

### 3. Viper

Viper is a tanky ranged carry who has a variety of poison-based abilities that are especially well suited to new players. Viper’s orb effect, Poison Attack, deals damage over time and slows the enemy. Poison Attack combined with one of Viper’s passives, Nethertoxin, makes last hitting extremely easy.This ease of last hitting allows Viper to farm much faster than other carries and then to dominate the game. Viper’s other passive, Corrosive Skin, damages and slows enemy heroes who attack him while also increasing his magic resistance, all of which makes viper very hard to kill.
