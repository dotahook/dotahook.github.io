With TI5 out of the way, everyone is eagerly (or not so eagerly for Leshrac pickers) waiting for a certain frigid amphibian to close the book on an era dominated by magical nukes and snowballing mid-laners. But in general we’re seeing a large number of heroes reaching competitive viability, so we think the next patch will avoid any drastic changes.

Here’s what changes we at Dotahook would like to see in 6.85 in hopes of reducing the prevalence of nukers and making some obscure heroes like Kunkka and Elder Titan more impactful. If we didn’t include a hero here, it’s probably because either we (a) don’t want the hero to be picked more, or because (b) this post was getting too long. Death Prophet, for instance, is quite weak right now, but we skipped over her because seeing her played competitively about as exciting as watching paint dry.

#Map
###Roshan
- Armor bonus per 4 minutes increased from 0.7 to 1.0
- Roshan now enrages after losing half of his max health, increasing total armor by 25% (including armor gained from Strength of the Immortal) and amplifying all damage he deals by 25%. This buff cannot be dispelled. He only gains the ability to enrage after the 30-minute mark.

The prevalence of anti-armor items (notably Solar Crest) makes chewing through Roshan extremely easy. Games that go late usually mean that one team can blow up Roshan in a matter of seconds. It’s embarrassing. Let the poor bastard put up a fight.

#Items
###Bloodstone
- Recipe cost increased from 900 to 1000
- Starts with 6 charges instead of 8

Delays snowballing mids slightly and makes them easier to control later on. Nerfs Timbersaw too, so we attempted to buff him.

###Glimmer Cape
- Cast range reduced from 900 to 700

This item is really strong so we think its utility needs to be toned down ever so slightly.

###Heaven’s Halberd
- Disarm now lasts 4 seconds for both ranged and melee targets
- Can no longer be purged by Spell Immunity

This item has been long ignored in many games for good reason; its late game utility is nonexistent when everyone has BKBs. With these changes, it can still make a difference when the game goes late.

#Heroes
###Alchemist
- Strength gain increased from 1.8 to 1.9
- Base armor increased from 0 to 1
- Acid Spray (Q) now applies a 10%/15%/20%/25% movement speed slow to the target radius for the duration

Alchemist is so weak right now that he could use modest buffs in everything. What he really needs is a rework to his skills, but I don’t have enough experience with him to say what he needs most.

###Bloodseeker
- Thirst (E) is no longer global. Now only affects Bloodseeker if enemy heroes within a radius of 3000 are injured
- Rupture (R) duration now scales from 10/12/14 seconds

I don’t think Bloodseeker is OP by any means, but Thirst needs to be dampened to make him a little less of a nuisance in the early game. Rupture can stand to be a little shorter at level 6, too.

Our always popular Bloodseeker guide is [here](https://dotahook.com/guides?hero=bloodseeker)

###Chaos Knight
- Phantasm (R) cooldown reduced from 140 to 140/130/120

This hero is too reliant on his illusions to be a proper carry. With such a long cooldown, he’s useless for a substantial amount of time. With greater uptime later on he can begin to dream of competing with Naga and Ebolancer

###Doom
- Base armor increased from -1 to 0
- Decreased cast point from 0.5 to 0.4
- Doom (R) now lowers target’s magic resistance by 10%/20%/30%

Doom is also all around bad now that his ultimate isn’t anywhere near as strong as it used to be, so we thought he could use a few minor buffs. His ultimate, unfortunately, is so anti-fun that most people don’t mind not having him around.

###Earth Spirit
- Added to Captain’s Mode
HAHAHAHA

###Elder Titan
- Earth Splitter (R) crack radius increased from 300 to 400 and now applies Break
- Aghanim’s upgraded Earth Splitter (R) damage type changed from Physical/Magical to Pure

This doesn’t address the many issues this hero has, but we know for certain that Earth Splitter is really underwhelming for having such an epic animation. It just requires so much set up that it should have a more punishing effect for the rare occasion someone gets stuck in it.

###Gyrocopter
- Rocket Barrage (Q) mana cost increased from 90 to 100
- Call Down (R) Missile One Damage rescaled from 250/300/350 to 200/250/300
- Missile One move speed slow reduced from 30% to 25%

This guy does tons of magic damage and Rocket Barrage is just too spammable. One of them has to go.

You can find our Gyrocopter guide [here](https://dotahook.com/guides?hero=gyrocopter) (check it out before he gets nerfed!)

###Kunkka
- Ghostship (R) stun duration increased from 1.4 to 2.0 and ship radius increased from 425 to 500. Aghanim’s Scepter upgrade changes damage type from Magical to Pure.

More pure damage for everyone!

###Lina
- Aghanim’s Scepter upgraded Laguna Blade (R) Pure damage reduced from 450/675/950 to 400/600/850
Except Lina, because getting instagibbed through BKB is just sad.

You can use our lina guide to get Aghanim's and instagib your foes. It's [here](https://dotahook.com/guides?hero=lina)

###Lifestealer
- Rage (Q) is now Lifestealer’s ultimate ability. It now reduces all incoming damage by 20%/30%/40% for the duration, which has been increased from 3/4/5/6 to 5/6/7
- Infest (R) is now a regular ability and its damage has been rescaled from 150/275/400 to 100/150/200/250

Currently one of the worst carries in the game, we think this will make him a little more fun and useful. Plus, we try to make Rage a little stronger against all the Pure damage spam, though we want to avoid making this skill too similar to Ursa’s ultimate.

If you'd like to learn Lifestealer before he gets buffed you can find our guide [here](https://dotahook.com/guides?hero=lifestealer)

###Leshrac
- Intelligence gain reduced from 3.0 to 2.8
- Lightning Storm (E) mana cost increased from 90/100/110/120 to 100/110/120/130
- Lightning Storm (E) cast range reduced from 800 to 700

Something like this is almost certainly going to be somewhere in the real patch notes.

Leshrac is really strong right now! check out [our guide](https://dotahook.com/guides?hero=leshrac) to learn how to reduce your foes to their elements!

###Lone Druid
- Spirit Bear’s Entangling Claws damage type changed from Physical to Pure
- True Form (R) now increases magic resistance of Lone Druid and Spirit Bear by 25%

Once a great pusher, he’s just too slow to come online to be relevant. At least with these buffs he’s a little bit tougher and his bear will always be a threat.

###Mirana
- Agility gain increased from 2.75 to 3.0
- Projectile speed increased from 900 to 1000

Makes carry Mirana more viable and gives her a better reason to go mid.

Even unbuffed Mirana is still a strong carry, our guide will help you

###Pit Lord
- Added to All Pick

When are we getting Pit Lord? [We tried to figure that out a while back](http://theblog.dotahook.com/2015/07/20/whenAreWeGettingPitLord/)

###Puck
- Waning Rift (W) now slows enemies in its radius by 10%/20%/30%/40%

- Dream Coil (R ) now disarms all heroes in the coil latch radius for 1/2/3 seconds. Disarm cannot be purged by Spell Immunity.

Puck’s damage is so lackluster that we felt he needs something to compensate. Especially Dream Coil, which we always found underwhelming because it’s difficult to use it when you’re losing. We thought this new version still fits with the lore behind the skill because Dream Coil causes enemies to be confused, which we think would prevent them from fighting briefly.

###Queen of Pain

- Sonic Wave (R) damage type changed from Pure to Magical. Aghanim’s Scepter upgrade now changes damage type from Magical to Pure.

Giving her Pure damage right off the bat seems a little generous, so we’d like to undo that.

Our Queen of Pain guide is [here](https://dotahook.com/guides?hero=queenOfPain)

###Techies
- Land Mines (Q) and Remote Mines (R) now have a 10 gold bounty

Supports should be compensated for playing minesweeper so that they are incentivized to buy more sentries.

###Terrorblade
- Increased Reflection (Q) cast range from 325 to 400
- Decreased Conjure Image (W) illusion damage taken from 425% to 375%

Yeah, this one’s probably not going to happen.

###Timbersaw
- Increase Intelligence gain from 2.4 to 2.6
- Timber Chain (W) mana cost decreased from 60/70/80/90 to 40/50/60/70
- Aghanim’s Scepter-upgraded Chakram (R) now only partially blocked by Spell Immunity. Spell Immune enemy units still take damage, but are immune to the slow

With the nerfs to Bloodstone, Timbersaw will need a lot of help since he’s already sub-par.

###Tusk
- Can no longer cast spells while in Snowball (W)

Most people agree that casting Ice Shards while in Snowball is too good.
